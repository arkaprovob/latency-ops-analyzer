# Latency vs Operations Performance Analyzer

## Project Overview
This project provides a visual analysis of how latency and the number of operations affect total execution time in a system or application. It demonstrates that for a moderate number of operations (up to 100), differences in latency may not significantly impact overall performance, potentially negating the need for costly hardware upgrades.

## Purpose
The main goals of this project are:
1. To visualize the relationship between the number of operations, latency, and total execution time.
2. To demonstrate at what point latency differences become significant.
3. To aid in decision-making regarding hardware investments for performance improvements.

## Key Components

### Equation
The analysis is based on the equation:

E = N(20ms + 3*L)

Where:
- E: Total execution time
- N: Number of operations
- 20ms: Constant application time
- L: Latency

### Variables
- T_app_in_ms: 20 (constant application time in milliseconds)
- redis_ops_per_call: 1 (number of Redis operations per call)
- N_values: Range from 1 to 100 (number of operations)
- Latencies tested: 1, 50, 100, 150, 175, 200 milliseconds

## Implementation
The project uses Python with matplotlib to generate a line chart visualization. Each line on the chart represents a different latency value, showing how the total execution time changes as the number of operations increases.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python latency_analyzer.py
   ```
3. The script will generate a PNG file named 'output.png' with the visualization.

## Output
The generated chart shows:
- X-axis: Number of operations (N) from 1 to 100
- Y-axis: Total execution time (E) in milliseconds
- Multiple lines representing different latency values

## Analysis
The resulting graph helps to visualize:
- How execution time increases with the number of operations
- The impact of different latencies on the overall execution time
- The point at which differences in latency become significant

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that for up to 100 operations, the impact of latency differences (which might be attributed to different hardware capabilities) on overall execution time may not be substantial enough to justify investing in more expensive hardware.

## Future Improvements
- Add interactive elements to the chart
- Implement user input for custom latency values and operation ranges
- Extend the analysis to include cost-benefit considerations for hardware upgrades
- Extend the analysis to include cost-benefit considerations for hardware upgrades
